# Cool_TShirts_Inc._Project
This is the fourth project for the Codecademy Data Science intensive course. Here we analyze the data of a hypothetical website called Cool T-Shirts and find out that, out of the total number of people vising the website, who actually ends up buying something.

# Objective
Cool T-Shirts Inc. has asked you to analyze data on visits to their website. Your job is to build a funnel, which is a description of how many people continue to the next step of a multi-step process.
In this case, our funnel is going to describe the following process:

1. A user visits CoolTShirts.com
2. A user adds a t-shirt to their cart
3. A user clicks "checkout"
4. A user actually purchases a t-shirt

# Explaination of the objective
1. So here we basically have to analyze out of the total people visiting the website, how many people end up NOT putting things in the cart.
2. Out of all the people that have actually put thing/s in the cart, how many people do NOT checkout.
3. Out of all the people that do checkout, how many people do NOT purchase it.

So, the funnels will let us know which part of the process from visiting to buying is the waeakest and that would be the area that the website needs to work on and what is the average time a user who actually buys something, spends on the website.

# Dependancies and Prerequisites 
1. Pandas
2. The intial data is stored in 4 csv files called "visits.csv","cart.csv","checkout.csv" and "purchase.csv". All other files are created by the code. 

# Extra Comments
1. All the print commands, except the one which actually shows you the summarized data has been commented out.
2. Improvements are welcome.
